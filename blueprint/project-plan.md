# Project Plan

> One of the two planning docs you provide. Use as much detail as the project
> needs, including rationale, constraints, examples, edge cases, and explicit
> exclusions that should guide later feature work. Draft it directly, develop it
> through any AI conversation, or optionally run `/discovery` for a guided deep
> planning session. The content is always yours to direct. When it is filled in,
> run `/overview` to generate the project overview from this plus `build-plan.md`.

## 1. Problem - What problem are we solving?

A reusable Payload CMS + Next.js starter template, kept as a template
repository that gets cloned into a fresh repo each time a new site is built,
rather than shipped as one specific product. It solves the "rebuild the same
CMS plumbing every time" problem: a block-based page builder, blog engine,
media pipeline, SEO, and a brand-swappable design token system already wired
together, so a new site starts from working infrastructure instead of an
empty Payload install.

## 2. Users - Who is this for?

The developer(s) maintaining this template and reusing it to launch new sites.
Not an end-user-facing product on its own; the "users" of a given deployment
are that site's own content editors (via the Payload admin) and visitors (via
the public frontend).

## 3. Features - What does the MVP need?

Already shipped (see `build-plan.md` for the checked list): block-based page
builder (Hero, FeatureGrid, CallToAction, RichText blocks via a single
registry), blog with categories and featured-post logic, media pipeline with
auto blur-placeholder generation and responsive image sizes, header/footer
navigation and branding globals, per-document SEO with canonical URLs and
sitemap control, cache-tagged rendering with revalidation on save, Payload
auth for admin access.

Immediate next milestone (in order): finish the Phase 7 legacy port (see
`src/_legacy/README.md`), then expand and refine the design token system.
New product features are deliberately on hold until that styling-system work
lands.

## 4. Data - What are we storing?

- `pages` - block-based layout documents (title, featured image, blocks, SEO)
- `posts` - blog entries (title, summary, author, category, featured flag,
  rich text body that can itself embed blocks, SEO)
- `categories` - post categories, with a reverse `join` back to related posts
- `media` - uploads with auto-generated blur placeholder and thumbnail/card/
  fullSize/og image sizes
- `users` - Payload auth collection (admin access)
- `header` (global) - logo/dark logo, site icon/dark icon, nav links, social
  links, CTA buttons, appearance (surface, width, position, height, transparent-
  at-top)
- `settings` (global) - site name, site description, Google Tag Manager code

## 5. Tech - What stack are we using?

- Next.js 16 (App Router, route groups for `(frontend)` and `(payload)` admin)
- Payload CMS 3.82, MongoDB via `@payloadcms/db-mongodb`
- Lexical rich text editor, with a `BlocksFeature` so blocks can be embedded
  inside post bodies
- Tailwind CSS v4, CSS-first `@theme` config with a two-tier token system
  (primitive palette + semantic roles) and `light-dark()` theming as the
  OS-driven default, with a manual override (`.dark`/`.light` class or
  `data-theme` attribute + persisted visitor preference) taking precedence
  when set
- `@payloadcms/plugin-seo` for per-document SEO fields
- Optional S3-compatible storage (`@payloadcms/storage-s3`), activates only
  when bucket/credential env vars are set; falls back to local storage
  otherwise
- Optional Resend email adapter, activates only when its env vars are set
- Vitest (`tests/int/**/*.int.spec.ts`) and Playwright configured for testing;
  no test files exist yet
- `@payloadcms/live-preview-react` - client-side live preview for Pages and
  Posts; unsaved editor changes merge into the rendered page via
  `postMessage`, no drafts/versions required

## 6. Monetize - How will this make money?

Not applicable. This is an internal starter template only - it is not
intended to be distributed or sold; it exists solely to bootstrap the
author's own future sites.

## 7. UI/UX - How should this look and feel?

Mid-migration: the site builder moved from CSS Modules to the Tailwind v4
token system described above. `src/_legacy/README.md` tracks what is still
quarantined pending a "Phase 7" port (`Pagination`, `PostPreview`,
`Breadcrumbs`, `PostNavigation`, `Card`, `CategoryFilter`, `Footer`, and the
blog routes) onto `components/primitives/` (`Section`, `Container`, `Stack`)
and the semantic tokens in `styles/tokens/_semantic.css`.

Design intent already encoded in the tokens: brand-swappable (components
reference only semantic roles, never raw palette values), light/dark via
`light-dark()`, and editor-controlled appearance (surface, spacing, width) so
content editors pick semantic roles rather than colors or pixel values.

A manual dark mode toggle is now planned (build plan item 14): a visitor-facing
control that overrides the OS `prefers-color-scheme` default and persists the
chosen mode across visits.

Editors also get a live-updating preview pane (build plan item 15): editing a
Page or Post in the admin panel shows unsaved changes rendered instantly, no
save required. Header/Footer/Settings live preview is a deliberate later
addition, not part of this pass.

The next planned UI/UX work, after the Phase 7 port, is making the token
system **portable across different project stacks**, not just this one.
Concretely: consolidate the design tokens (colors, typography, spacing,
shadows, border-radius) into a single `branding.css` file that can be dropped
into other projects independently of the Payload/Next.js/Tailwind plumbing
around it.

Alongside that file, add a personality-selection guide based on the
**Website-Personalities-Framework** (`theory-lectures.pdf`, section 26 /
lecture 26, the capstone of the "Web Design Rules and Framework" module). The
framework's method: pick one of 7 website personalities based on the desired
"vibe," then apply that personality's traits across 7 design ingredients
(typography, colors, images, icons, shadows, border-radius, layout). The 7
personalities: Serious/Elegant, Minimalist/Simple, Plain/Neutral,
Bold/Confident, Calm/Peaceful, Startup/Upbeat, Playful/Fun. It also teaches a
"trait injection" technique for blending traits from a neighboring
personality (on a Bold-Calm x Playful-Serious quadrant) into a primary
choice, rather than treating the 7 as rigid, mutually-exclusive buckets.
Full per-personality detail lives in the source PDF; capture the specific
token/guide structure when this is spec'd with `/feature`.

## 8. Deployment - Where and how will this ship?

Not decided / per-project: since this is a template repository cloned per
site, the deploy target is chosen when a given site is built from it, not
fixed here. The originating course (`payload-essentials-trancript.md`) used Railway,
but that is not a commitment for this template.

`.env.example` documents the required and optional env vars: `DATABASE_URL`,
`PAYLOAD_SECRET` (required); `SITE_NAME`; `S3_API`/`S3_BUCKET`/
`S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`/`S3_PUBLIC_URL` (optional storage);
`RESEND_API_KEY`/`EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`/`EMAIL_FROM_NAME` (optional email).
