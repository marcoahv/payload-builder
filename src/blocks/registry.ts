 *   2. add its config to `blockConfigs` and its component to `blockComponents`
 *
 * Nothing else changes. `payload.config.ts` spreads `blockConfigs` into its
 * top-level `blocks`, `collections/Pages` picks them up via `blockSlugs`,
 * `RenderBlocks` dispatches through `blockComponents`, and the rich-text
 * converters derive from the same map.
